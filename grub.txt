###WARNING: This line and below, and all "<>" above must be deleted before you copy into GRUB config file.###
###Add "rmmod tpm" to the first line if you're using Linux Mint or Ubuntu's GRUB. Grub2Win do not need this.###
###"a" in "/dev/sdaX" means "Disk 0" (except for NVMe drive), "X" is the partition No., e.g. C in general Windows 10 UEFI boot PC is "sda4", because "ESP", "MSR", "Recovery" should be the first 3 partitions. The first "X" in "nvmeXnXpX" means "slot X", secone "X" is "disk X", and third "X" is "partition X", e.g. "nvme0n1p7" means "NVMe slot 0, disk 1, partition 7". Partition name could be very difficult to identify. You can use GParted (or other partition tools) on Linux to determine which name you should input. "diskpart" in Windows and partition info listed in Grub2Win CANNOT be referenced.###
